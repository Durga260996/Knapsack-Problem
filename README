Knapsack is a famous optimization problem. 

Indiana Jones: """There are lot of artifacts available in this dungeon. 
               But I cant carry all these artifacts in my Knapsack. 
               I have to find an optimal way to select the artifacts to fit in this bag"""

For this project I have used Greedy algorithm and dynammic programming.
I'll update this file when I use new algorithms for solving the knapsack problem.
